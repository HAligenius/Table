# How to create Table in Javascript

first we take a variable like a and convert it into parse int

parseInt() convert string into Integer(Number)

for loops is use to repeat a number
 there are three things put in for loop.

  * declare datatype with value
  * condition
  * increment and decrement

    Document.write();

   this is use print any things 

   so now we use for loop like that
   
    * for(i=1; i<=10; i++)
    {
    	document.write(a+"x"+i+"="+i*a+"<br>");
    }
      Output like that
       .6x1 = 6
       .6x2 = 12
         .
         .
         .
         .
       .6x10 = 60
